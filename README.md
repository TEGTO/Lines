#### :skull: Just an old-school lines game made by java on andoird. I use this [site](http://dmitry.baranovskiy.com/lines2/) as inspiration.

#### Rules (<strike>stolen</strike> borrowed): 
To move a ball, click on it (circle will appear) to select it, then click on a free cell in a field. To deselect a ball just click on another. 

If movement is possible, ball will go to the specified empty field. After each turn, 3 new balls are placed on a field (random colours & positions). 

If the game field is full, game is over. Game goal is to arrange balls of the same colour in a straight lines (every direction). 5 or more balls on a straight line are removed and points are given.

Longer lines give more points to you. Crossing lines count together.

> #### You may use the code or sounds as you want.
